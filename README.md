# FirstCNN

This is my first Convolutional Neural Network using the FashionMNIST dataset. 
This project gave me a good understanding of how we can turn a dataset into mini-batches and its benefits.
Also, why CNNs are a good choice when it comes to image classification problems.
At 5 epochs I was able to get a Train acc: 90.35% and Test acc: 88.25%.
